                            Law</a> (or the Hick-Hyman Law) is named after a British and an American psychologist team
                        of
                        William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman. In 1952, this pair set out to examine the relationship
                        between
                        the number of stimuli present and an individual’s reaction time to any given stimulus. As you
                        would
                        expect, the more stimuli to choose from, the longer it takes the user to make a decision on
                        which
                        one to interact with. Users bombarded with choices have to take time to interpret
                        and decide, giving them work they don’t want. <br> One site that uses this is in their design is
                        <a href="https://www.us.yahoo.com/">Yahoo.com</a> I
                        like how the have a corrousel for the main articles at the beggining instead of scrolling and
                        scrolling a lot of articles never knowing what to read.</p>

                            law</a> states that
                        the amount of time required for a person to move a pointer (e.g., mouse cursor) to a target
                        area
                        is a function of the distance to the target divided by the size of the target. Thus, the
                        longer
                        the distance and the smaller the target’s size, the longer it takes.<br>Codecademy is an
                        example
                        of how to improve the buttons using the law of Fitt's. By making bigger buttons as call to

                    <p class="p-three"><a
                            href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-rule-of-thirds-know-your-layout-sweet-spots">Rule
                            of thirds</a> is another way to look at the layout of a design (be it a web page, a
                        painting or a photograph). The idea is straightforward; you place a simple grid overlay
                        (divided equally into thirds, both horizontally and vertically) on the space to be used for
                        the design. This makes a grid of nine equal-shaped boxes. To do this, we make two sets of
                        parallel lines at even places over a background. So, going from the top left, measure the
                        width of your background. If you’ve got a width of 36 cm, mark out points at 12 cm and 24
                        cm. Then, look at the height.
                        So,
                        again
                        going from the top left, measuring down, we get a reading of 24cm. Therefore, mark out
                        points at
                        8-cm intervals (8 cm and 16 cm down). Now that we have our grid points set, we can make the
                        grid!<br>Yahoo and Espn are examples of how to use the rule of thirs in mobile. The
                        pictures
                        are always one
                        third of the screen. Even in The ESPN page where they have a big article before every little
                        article
                        both pictures are part of a third part of the screen or of the article.</p>
